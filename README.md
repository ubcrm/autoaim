#Autoaim
Apart from in-code comments, we host [guides and documentation](https://ubcrobomaster.slite.com/app/channels/dA4dO1hHij/notes/ZYTtyAq~lp) on the vision Slite channel.

[Autoaim Intro](https://ubcrobomaster.slite.com/app/channels/dA4dO1hHij/notes/xn1FDEEL2l) provides a general introduction to get you started. The following more specific guides are also available.
* [Panel Classifier](https://ubcrobomaster.slite.com/app/channels/dA4dO1hHij/notes/PBxt9ou6BB) for how to train, convert, and do inference with our panel classification model.
* [Raspberry Pi Setup](https://ubcrobomaster.slite.com/app/channels/dA4dO1hHij/notes/dBspLGe9VC) for how to setup a Pi to run our source code.

More documentation is always welcome!
